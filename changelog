v5.0 (planing)
1. support for SGE cluster;
2. support for lauching multiple assembly tasks at the assembly step.
3. add checkpoint, so that we can resume the jobs.
4. protein-tranlsation check and filter out the ones have stop codons
(codon-based alignment with a reference? Or just DNA-alignment???)

Maybe: the output contig by the 'barcode' program is always 5'->3' (ask
shanlin to double confirm), so we translate the contig from frame 1, 2, 3.
If all frames have stop codons, we remove this contig.

5. remove the barcodes contig with 0X-depth

6. upgrade BWA '0.5.9-r16' to '0.7.17-r1198-dirty'
v4.2
1. change usearch to vesearch.
2. partially fixed a bug during read the lib file (-lib option).
3. use log4perl module (https://www.perl.com/pub/2002/09/11/log4perl.html/)
for logging.

v3.0
